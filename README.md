* On Top of the All Campgrounds map you can see a map , showing all the campground entries in the YelpCamp website in a form of clusters, if you zoom into them they become unclustered (there is only one campground there you can add more and explore other campgrounds) and you can go to that particular campground page just by clicking the unclustered point on map.

* For Zoom in and out you need to scroll at that point with the help of mouse.

* Another way of viewing campground is to select from all campgrounds list and click on view campground button.
* After clicking you are now in the campround page where you can read about that Campground Place and go through all the images. If you want to know that exact campground location you can also view it on the map that is given beside.
